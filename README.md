# Language-website
The skeleton of a website built for young kids/teens interested in Irish.

This project is a language learning website for kids and young teenagers
and I will go through every webpage and detail my thoughts while making it.


WEBPAGE 1 (index1)
This is my homepage where I introduce what the website is and what it is.

I looked through a lot of webpages and saw that they all had a big Header
with a title and picture and a sub title, so I put that in my website.

Then I made a navigation bar, to link all the other webpages in the file.
I used javascript, so when an icon is clicked on the top right a dropdown
menu shows and lets the user click to go to a new webpage.

Then I made sections in the webpage with pictures beside it to make
it look cleaner and more appealing.

Then a quote box for an inspirational quote.

Then a footer for copyright and the likes.

Everything is responsive with a mix of pixels and percentages.




WEBPAGE 2 (The basics)
The second webpage is where the learning actually takes place

Introduction of notes showing up on screen to talk to someone learning
and to someone correcting the work :).

Tables showing words in Irish and what they mean in English is just a styled table

Needed to make the work responsive so I made cards with a shadow as a styling
and they float.

link to next webpage.




WEBPAGE 3 (ThebasicsV2)
Third webpage where the user learns objects and what they mean instead of grammar4

responsive css grid using auto fill, yay.
go to the basics.css page to see a better and more indepth explaination.

I thought a cool idea would be to have
pictures with words and when you hover over the pics you have gifs




WEBPAGE 4 (Games)
Fourth webpage will be quizzes

making quizzes using javascript and forms for user to enter the answers
using the cards to make the quizzes responsive

final quiz is not my design, I linked it in the css, I just thought it
was a really cool design and implemented it



WEBPAGE 5 (The country)
Fifth webpage supposed to tell users about the country

already said in the notes section I just used fun facts from a random webpage
but the design in entirely mine

big responsive picture of bridge in Ireland
replaced the dots in a list with an image of star, pretty cool

made a gallery? not really sure what to call it, made a design where
if you hover over an image it shows a bigger version of that image pretty cool




WEBPAGE 6 (Resources)
sixth webpage just giving the user links to further improve their learning

lists with links
iframe of a website
